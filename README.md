# Operation-analytics-and-metric-spike
Operation analytics is the analysis performed for a company's whole end-to-end
operations. This helps the business identify the areas where it needs to make
improvements. You collaborate closely with the operations team, the support team, the
marketing team, etc. and assist them in drawing conclusions from the data they gather.

Being one of the most crucial components of a business, this form of analysis is also utilised
to forecast the general upward or downward trend in a company's fortune. Better
automation, improved communication among cross-functional teams, and more efficient
workflows are the results.

Investigating metric spikes is crucial for operation analytics since a data analyst must be
able to comprehend questions or help other teams grasp them.
